# Zee_Recommender_SystemCase
Problem Statement:
Create a Recommender System to show personalized movie recommendations based on ratings given by a user and other users similar to them in order to improve user experience.
Approach:
In this project, I have built a recommender system that is going to recommend movies to a user based on their preferences as well as the choices of other users who are similar to them.
Concepts Tested:

* Recommender Engine

* Collaborative Filtering (Item-based & User-based Approach)

* Pearson Correlation

* Nearest Neighbors using Cosine Similarity
